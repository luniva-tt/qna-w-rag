  "Classification of Living Beings": "Look at the picture below and discuss the following questions: ( Fal» Bacteria Eugleni Fern fig i. According to five kingdom classification, which kingdom do these organisms belong to? ii. How are bacteria and Euglena different from each other? iii, What could bethe similarities and dissimilarities between a mushroom and a fern? On what basis, are ferns and frogs placed in plant and animal kingdom, respectively? Environment is a home for microscopic organisms to giant organisms like bluewhale, elephant, banyan, peepal, etc. On the basis of structure of cell, body structure, mode of nutrition, presence or absence of cell wall etc., Robert Harding Whittaker Classified these organisms into the five kingdoms. Among them, we already discussed about kingdoms monera, protista and fungi in grade nine. Here, lets recall the main characteristics of the organisms that belong to those three kingdoms. All the organisms that belong to monera have prokaryotic cell. Protista includes unicellular organisms whereas fungus consists of saprotrophic organisms that have cell wall but no chlorophyll Among the organisms given above, bacteria have prokaryotic cell. Euglena is a unicellular organism. Mushroom does not have chlorophyll. And it decomposes dead and decaying plants to derive its food. Fern is an autotroph because of the presence of chlorophyll but frogs are heterotrophs because they lack chlorophyll.

Plantae Kingdom Look at the picture below and discuss the following questions: Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade i. What are the simi picture? larities in the organisms shown in the ii, In which kingdom do they belong? iii, What are the main features ofthe kingdom they belong to? iv. What are the differences between moss and fern? Chlamydomonas, moss, fern, pine, pea, maize have green pigments called chlorophyll in their body. They belong to kingdom plantae that includes unicellular as well as multicellular green plants. Their cell wall is made up of cellulose. They are autotrophs. ‘Some of these plants are flowering and some are non-flowering. On the basis of their structure, these plants are classified into three divisions: Algae, Bryophyta and Trachaeophyta. . Algae Activity . The study of Algae Objective: To identify the characteristics of algae Materials required: Bottle, dropper, glass slide, cover slips, and compound microscope Method i. Collect water with algae in a bottle from a nearby pond or a damp marshy place, ii, Put a drop of water along with algae on the slide with the help of dropper. Cover the algae with a cover slip. iv. Observe the slide undermicroscope. v. After observing, draw a diagram to show the structure of the algae. vi, Based on the observation, discuss the characteristics of the algae. Conclusion Observe the given picture and identify their characteristics. Spirogyra Figure In plants -Spirogyra, Volvox, Fucus etc. shown in the picture, root stem and leaf cannot be differentiated. Their plant body is called thallus. Their cells contain cell wall and chlorophyll. These plants belong to division algae. Characteristics of the plants under this division are as follow: a. They are either unicellular or multicellular. b, They are autotrophs due to the presence of chlorophyll. ‘They prepare and store food in the form of starch. c. Their cell wall is composed of cellulose. . They reproduce both sexually and asexually. e. These plants are found in pond, river, sea and marshy places. Example: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Spirogyra, Ulothrix, Fucus etc. . Bryophyta Activity . Observation of the moss Objecti Materials required: moss, needle, chart paper Method : To identify the characteristics of bryophyta. i, Take a moss plant. Observe its various parts and identify them, om Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade Note its features based on the observation. iv. Drawits neat diagram on a chart paper based on observation. v. Browse the internet and find out its other characteristics. vi, Present the characteristics of bryophyta in your class on the basis of internet research and direct observation of the moss. vii. Based on the discussion, make a list of characteristics of bryophyta. Gonctusion Look at the picture below and identify their characteristics. iE Figure : Plants such as Marchantia, moss, Riccia shown in the picture are more developed than algae. They are green plants. Plant body of Marchantia is thallus but plant body of moss is differentiated into rhizoid, stem, and simple leaf. These plants are found in moist and shady places. Plants under bryophyta need water for fertilization. So, they are also called amphibian plants. General characteristics of plants under bryophyta are as follows: a. They are multicellular plants. b. They are autotrophs. c. Plant body is either thallus or differentiated into rhizoid, stem and simple leaf. d. They are found in moist and shady places. e. These plants are dioecious and plant body is gametophyte. Male plant produces male gamete in antheridium. Female plant produces female gamete in archegonium. Hence, this phase is called gametophyte. The male gamete is released from antheridium andreaches thearchegonium through ‘water, where it fuses with the ovum to forma zygote. Then, zygote germinates and develops into as porophyte. In this phase, the spore mother cell divides by meiosis to form haploid spores. This phase is called the sporophyte phase because spores are produced here. {The phenomenon in which sporophytic and gametophytic generation come one after another to complete life cycle of a plant is called alternation of generation. The gametophytic generation is dominant and independent in the life cycle of these plants. They have no vascular tissue. So they grow upto few centimetres high or are found attached and spread on substratum. Example: Marchantia, moss, Riccia, etc. . Tracheophyta Obsorve tho picture below and discuss thoir structure and characteristics Figure Plant body of fern, Cycas, banana, peepal etc. shown in the picture is differentiated into root, stem and leaf, They have xylem Scionce and Tachnalogs, Grade and phloem as vascular tissue which perform transportation of, substances throughout the bod So these plants are under the division tracheophyta. Division tracheophyta includes non-flowering fern plant, small herbs, shrubs to huge and developed plants. On the basis of structure, plants in division tracheophyta are classified into three subdivisions: pteridophyta, gymnosperm and angiosperm. A. Ptoridophyta Activity . Observation of the fern Objective: To identify the characteristics of fern Materials required: fern plant, chart paper, gum, etc. Method i. Bring a rooted fern plant. Observe its root, stem and leaves thoroughly. Note down its characteristics based on observation. iv. Draw a neat diagram of fern plant on chart paper on the basis of your observation, v. Paste the chart paper on aboard and discuss its feature in the class. vi, Based on the discussion, prepare a list of characteristics of fern plant Conclusion a Fem horse tat clubmoss Figure Root, stem and leaves are prominent in the plants like fern, clubmoss, horse tail and these plants donot bear flower. They have feather like leaves. Generally, their stem is in the form of rhizome which lies horizontally under the soil. General characteristics of the plants under the subdivision pteridophyta are mentioned below: a, b. They are found in moist and shady places. ‘They have no seed but plant body is differentiated into root stem and leaf. Leaf is feather like; stem is under-developed in the form of rhizome and root is developed. ‘They have developed vascular tissue like xylem and phloem. ‘These plants have numerous brown spots on the lower surface of leaves which are called sori (singular: sorus). Inside the sorus lies sporangium (plural:sporangia) that produces spores. Some leaves may not contain sori. Leaf with sori is called sporophyll and that without sori is called tropophyll. Plant body is called sporophyte because it produce shaploid spores. Spores fall on the ground by the rupture of sporangia which germinate into gametophytes named prothalli (sing., prothallus) under suitable condition. Gametophyte produces both male and female gametes. Their life cycle also shows alternation of generation. Sporophytic phase is dominant and lasts longer. Plants like Fem, fiddlehead fern, Ground gooseberry, Lycopodium, Selaginaella, Pleris etc.fall under this division. Scionce and Tochnalogs B. Gymnosperm Look at the pictures given below and discuss. ms yeas Figure i. Do these plants bear flower? ii, Where can we find their seeds and what do they look like? iii, How are their leaves different from leaves of other plants? Plants such as Gycas, Juniper, Pinus etc. are kept under flowering plants but they bear cones instead of flowers. They have naked seeds without fruits. So these plants are kept in the sub-division gymnosperm, Following are the characteristics of the plants under the sub-division gymnosperm: a. Incourse of evolution of plants, gymnosperms are the first plant to produce seed. b. They bear cones instead of flowers. Male and female cones are separate, So they are unisexual. Pollination takes place through wind. There is no ovary in cone and hence no fruits. Seed is naked. ‘Their leaves are elongated and needle like. Stem is enclosed within thick bark Shape of these plants is inverted cone like and hence they are called coniferous plants. g. The roots of these plants are spread far into the ground. peas Example: Cycas, Pinus, Juniper, Himalayan yew, Himalayan cedar . Angiosperm b figure Plants such as soybean, bamboo, etc. are real flowering plants. They have seeds enclosed in fruit. Sothese plants are placed under subdivision angiosperm. General characteristics of plants kept under angiosperm are given below: a. They are most advanced plants of kingdom plantae. b. These plants are found everywhere in land and water. c. They have well developed root, stem, leaf, flower and fruit. d. They bear real flower and flower contains both ovary and ovule. e. Some plants are bisexual and some are unisexual. £. Pollination takes place through various medium such as wind, water, insects, animal. These plants contain seeds inside the fruit. Orange, maize, banana, paddy, soybean, water hyacinth, Lemna, Pistia, etc. belong to this subdivision. On the basis of number of cotyledons present in their seeds, angiosperms are grouped into two classes- monocotyledon and dicotyledon a. Monocotyledon Activity .

Conclusion Mustard Soybean Orange Bean Pea Figure . Plants shown in the picture, such as mustard, pea, orange, soybean, and bean, have broad and flat leaves. There is a mid-rib from which many veins and veinlets arise forming a network throughout the leaf blade. They have a prominent main rootfrom which small root branches arise. Their seeds contain two cotyledons. So they are placed in the class dicotyledon. Dicotyledonous plants have following characteristics: a, These plants range from small shrubs to very large trees. b. They have a taproot system. ©. The stem is solid, strong, and mostly woody. Nodes are present at unequal intervals. Vascular bundles are arranged in a ring-like form within the stem. Reticulate venation is found in the leaf. The stem is petiolated and leaf is either simple or compound. Seeds are enclosed within fruit. The seed consists of two cotyledons. Soybean, mustard, pea, orange, mango, gram, beans, pumpkin, etc.,belong to this class. Activity .

Scionce and Tochnalogs . Kingdom Animalia Look at the picture of animals given below and discuss. di a i. Which kingdom do these animals belong to? ii, Do they have cell wall in their cells? . Which animals have a vertebral column? iv. What differences are found in starfish and fish? v, What is the reason for placing all these animals in one kingdom? All these animals have body made up of eukaryotic cells without cell walls. These animals are heterotrophs. Sycon, earthworms, cockroaches and starfishes have no vertebral column or backbone.But fish, pigeons, and cows have a vertebral column in their body. Various types of animals are found in this kingdom. ‘These animals differ in their body structure, shape, forms, etc. Some animals possess an endoskeleton, while some animals’ bodies are covered by hard exoskeletons. Body structure is simple in some animals while all the systems are developed in the body of some animals. Some animals under this kingdom have no vertebral column in their body. They are called invertebrates. Animals having vertebral column are called vertebrates. According to the five kingdom system, among the animals in kingdom Animalia, the animals withouta vertebral column are classified into eight phyla: Porifera, Coelenterata, Platyhelminthes, Nemathelminthes, Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Echinodermata. Animals with a notochord and vertebral column are classified under the phylum Chordat Hence, there are altogether nine phyla in the kingdom Animali Porifera Look at the pictures of animals given below and discuss: ‘Spongilta ‘Sycon Euspongia Figure . i. Where can these organisms be found? ii, How can they perform nutrition and excretion? ii, How do they move from one place to another place? Spongilla, Sycon, and Euspongia in the figure are multicellular organisms. They are found in marine water (sea). They have pores in their body. Water enters and exits the body through these pores. So these animals are kept in phylum Porifera. These a Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade animals are also called poriferans or sponges. They are found attached on the substratum. General characteristics of animals under this phylum are given below: a. They are the first multicellular organisms. b. Tissue is not developed in these organisms. c. Theirbody develops from two germ layers in the embryonic stage and hence, they are called diploblastic animals. cd. They have pores in their body in which a larger pore is called osculum and smaller pores are called ostia. Water enters the body through ostia and exits through osculum which is called water canal system. e. They respire through the general body surface. £ Their adult forms are found attached to substratum. & They have high regeneration capacity. When their body splits accidentally into pieces, each piece give rise to anew individual. h. They reproduce both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction takes place by budding and regeneration, and sexual reproduction takes place by the formation of gametes. i. Theirbodiesare radially symmetrical in some forms i.e. body is divisible into equal halves by any one of many longitudinal planes. They are mostly asymmetrical. Animals such as Sponge, Leucosolenia, Hylonema, Cliona, etc., are grouped under this phylum. Coelenterata Look at the pictures of animals given below and make discussions: Hydra Jollytish Coral fig2. i. What may be the function of appendages or outgrowths arising from the body of these animals? ii. How do these animals obtain their food? iii, What is the structure of the body of these animals? ‘The appendages or outgrowths arising from the body of Hydra, Coral, and Jellyfish shown in the picture are called tentacles. Tentacles help in feeding and movement. They have an internal hollow cavity in their body which is called coelenterons, and hence they are kept in the phylum coelenterata. General characteristics of the organisms under this phylum are given below: a, Animals in this phylum are multicellular and diploblastic. They are the first tissue graded animals:They have an empty vessel-like hollow cavity inside the body called coelenteron. Coelenteron is also called gastrovascular cavity since it performs the functions of both digestion and transportation. c. They have a single opening of the alimentary canal, which is called the mouth. The mouth is surrounded by tentacles. Their feeding and locomotion take place by tentacles. Tentacles contain stinging cells or nomatocysts which help to sting/kill and capture the prey. = Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade d. They respire through the general body surface. e. They reproduce both sexually and asexually. Asexual reproduction takes place by budding and regeneration method. They are found in ponds, lakes, and seas. . Their bodies show radial symmetry. Example: Hydra, Coral, Jellyfish, etc. Platyhelminthes Observe the picture given below. If possible, Search the internet about these animals and discuss the following questions: Lvertiuke Figure .

The body of animals such as tapeworms, liverflukes, blood flukes shown in the picture is like the tape or flat leaf. Animals belonging to this group are mostly parasites. They get shelter in the bodies of other animals. These animals are classified under the phylum platyhelminthes. ‘Platy’ means flat and ‘helminthes means worms. Their general characteristics are: a. Shape of their body is flat leaf-like or long ribbon-like and hence they are called flatworms b. Their body is developed from three germ layers in the Science and Technology, Grade embryonic stage. So, they are triploblastic animals. c. Atthe anterior and ventral surface of their body lies mouth, but these animals are without anus. The mouth is surrounded by hooks thathelp them to attach to the host. d. A sucker is found around the mouth tht helps to attach and absorb blood and nutrients from the host. e. They donot have well-developed organ system. ‘The space between the body wall and internal organs is filled up with parenchyma tissue, It helps in transportation. There is no circulatory system. They respire through their general body surface. h. They have male and female reproductive organs in the same body, and hence they are called hermaphrodite or bisexual animals. Fertilization is internal, cy i. They reproduce both sexually and asexually. Asexual reproduction takes place by fragmentation and regeneration. j. They are mostly parasites and a few are free-living. Examples: Liverfluke, Tapeworm, Diplozoon, Otoplana, Blood fluke, Planaria etc, Nemathelminthes Look at the picture given below and discuss the following questions. Co & Figure .

BOK ii, ili, iv. What are the similarities in the body structure of these animals? Where are these animals found? What is the outer covering of their body made up of? Why are these animals kept in phylum Arthropoda? Butterflies fly from a flower to another with the help wings. Centipedes have many legs, prawns and crabs live in water. They have jointed legs. So, these animals belong to phylum arthropoda. This phylum is the largest one in the animal kingdom. Animals in this phylum have following characteristics: a. FS ‘Their body is externally covered by a hard covering called exoskeleton which is made up of chitin, The body is bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic, and segmented. Their body is divisible into the head, thorax, and abdomen. In some forms, the head and thorax arefused and called cephalothorax. The head bears a pair of compound eyes, paired antennae and mouth parts. Legs are jointed and arising from thorax. rally, insects have two pairs of wings. But one pair of wings is present in some arthropods or sometimes wings are absent. Male and female are separate. They perform sexual reproduction.

Carefully observe the collected animals. Classify them on the basis of external feature into different phyla. Prepare a report on it and present in the class room. Phylum: Chordata ‘This phylum consists of the most advanced animals of animal Kingdom. All animals bearing a notochord are classified in the Chordata phylum. Animals belonging to this phylum have the following characteristics: a. They havea developed, elastic, rod-like notochord between the nerve cord and alimentary canal at any stage of life. b. Paired lateral gill openings are situated on both sides of pharynx in the embryonic stage c. A hollow, tubular nervous tissue is found in the vertebral canal. 4d. The skeleton is covered with muscles. e. They have a closed circulatory system. Phylum Chordata is divided into four sub-phyla. They are Hemichordata, Urochordata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata. The first three subphyla arecollectively called Protochordata since animals belonging to these subphyla are more primitive than the animals in Vertebrata. Here, we are going to discuss sub-phylum Vertebrata only. Sub-phylum vertebrata mk us Fish ‘Snake Figure . All the animals shown in picture have backbone or vertebral column. Animals having vertebral column are called vertebrates. Notochord developed in the embryonic stage of these animals is later replaced by vertebral column. Fish, frog, snake, pigeon, whale, Bat, etc. are under the subphyhum vertebrata. They have mostly similar features, however very few features are not common. Animals belonging to this sub-phylum have the following features: a. Their body is bilaterally symmetrical. b. The respiration takes place through gills or moist skin or lungs. ‘The body temperature of some animals which are called Scionce and Tachnology, Grade poikilothermic or cold blooded animals, changes according to the surrounding environment. d. The body temperature of some animals which are called homeothermic or warm blooded animals does not change according to the surrounding environment. They maintain their body temperature slightly higher than that of environment, e. They have well developed circulatory system. Number of heart chambers range from two to four. f. Some animals called oviparous give birth to their young ones by laying eggs while some animals called viviparous directly give birth to their young ones. Based on their physical structure and development, animals in sub-phylum vertebrata are divided into five classes: pisces, amphibian, reptilia, aves, and mammalia.

Classification of living being i, Which organisms do you think evolved earlier among the organisms under the protists and the organisms under the monerans? ii, The five kingdoms are shown in the tree diagram. Discus the relationship between the evolution and classification of living beings based on the given diagram. When we study the basis of five kingdom classification, some kingdoms have many common features but a few of them have Jess common features. It indicates that all livings beings have common ancestry. Here, the common characteristics of all living beings is that their body is developed from a living cell = Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade Classification of living beings shows that prokaryotic organisms evolved first on the Earth, which are now in the kingdom Monera. Then, eukaryotic organisms evolved slowly, which are now in the Protista kingdom. During the courseof evolution, other multicellular organisms like fungi, plants, and animals developed gradually. Classification of living beings and evolution are separate disciplines of biology. Classification of living beings is the process of grouping them on the basis of their similarities and differences. Similarly, evolution is the process of gradual change of living beings from a simpler to a more complex form. Those animals which have many common features are kept in the same group in the classification of living beings. When we compare the animals of class Mammalia and Aves, they have a few common features. When we compare the animals of class Mammalia and Pisces, they have very few common features. It indicates that animals belonging to mammals under went speciation from the same ancestor some years ago. When we observe the animals within group vertebrata, pisces have two-chambered heart. Reptiles have three-chambered heart but aves and mammals have a four-chambered heart. It also indicates that advanced animals developed from less developed animals. Classification of living beings is possible because of such differences in the organisms. What we know from the common features in pisces, aves and mammals is that the organisms belonging to these three classes evolved from the same ancestor many years ago. During the course of evolution, they developed new characteristics and, in this way, new organisms were formed. Here, aves arecloser to mammalia than pisces. This means thataves and mammals appear to have diverged from a common ancestor only a few years earlier than pisces. Common features of pisces, mammalia and aves indicate that they were developed from a distant common ancestor. In this way, if we study the characteristics of various phyla in the animal kingdom, we can find some similarities among them. It proves that all the organisms of the animal kingdom have common ancestry. In course of evolution, they advanced into various new forms. Project work .

  "Honey Bee": "Observe the picture given below and discuss: Figure . Bee hive What type of hive is shown in the picture? ii, Should humans make hives for bees? iii, What type of animal is a bee? Let's study the event ‘Sanumaya was watering the flowers in her garden. At that time, ntion was drawn to the buzzing sound of some insects. ‘She began to look carefully to see why those insects had been buzzing. Then, she noticed that those insects were honey bees. ‘They were flying and sucking nectar from flowers. Sanumaya looked the bees attentively for some time, She saw that the bees ‘were sitting on flowers for a while before flying away. She tried to find out where they were going, and after following, She saw the bees were sitting in a hive made in a nearby tree. Although froma little distance, she also observed the hive and saw various types of bees there. Have you ever seen a beehive in your home or locality? Based Scionco and Tochnology, Grade = on your experience or the aforementioned event, discuss the following questions: i. What do honeybees feed on to survive? ii, Are all the bees of same type in a beehive? iii, What lessons can be learned from bees? iv. Do bees help humans only by producing honey, or do they help in other ways too? A bee is an insect that lives freely in a special type of hive that has made for itself. It belongs to the phylum Arthropoda, While farming honeybees, farmers construct artificial hives for them. Honey beesare social insects living in large colony. There are three types of honey bees called queen, worker, and drone, living in a hive. There is a high level of understanding and discipline among the members of the bee colony. A high degree of division of labour is also found among them. Every member of the bee colony is very disciplined and hardworking, and they keep themselves busy all the time. Honeybees collect pollen and nectar to make honey. ‘Human beings have been adopting traditional methods of farming dees since ancient times. Since the 20th century, beekeeping has been done not only for the production of honey but also for pollination and for producing wax. Nowadays, modern hives are used for beekeeping as an agricultural business, from which more honey can be produced. Commercial rearing of bees is called apiculture. A separate study of bees is done for farming bees from a business point of view. The science that studies bees is called melittology or apicology which is a branch of entomology (the science of insects). Activity . Observation and study of the bee Objective: Study the physical structure of the bee oo ‘Science and Twchnologs, G Material required: If possible, all types of bees, if not, a video or picture showing the external structure of all bees. Method Make three groups of students in the classroom. ‘Take a picture of a bee or watch a video and study its body structure ii, Now draw a neat diagram of the bee you observed and note its characteristics. iv. Present and discuss the findings of each group turn by turn, Conclusion: Conclude the structure of honey bee based on discussion. FP GR om Queen bee Drone bee Worker bee Figure3. Types of bee Generally, the size ofa bee ranges from mm to mm in length. Like other insects, their body is divided into head, thorax, and abdomen. They have paired compound eyes, paired antennae and mouth parts in their head. They detect surroundings stimuli b the help of antennae. Compound eyes can see without rotating the head. Thorax consists of three segments. From each segment arise a pair of legs. Legs are jointed, so they are kept in the phylum Arthropoda. The first two segments of the thorax give rise to a pair of wings which help them to fly a far distance, The abdomen consists of segments, but segments are prominent in adult females and segments in adult males. In a hive, three types of bees are present: queen bee, drone bee Scionco and Technology, Grade oe and worker bee. Each member has their own characteristics, which is studied here: Queen bee ‘The queen bee is the largest sized and elongated bee in the beehive. Its head is smaller and rounded than others. Its proboscis is short and covered with hairs. Sting is present at the end of abdomen. Generally, there is only one queen in the hive. Its main function is to lay eggs. It controls activities of all bees in the hive according to the situation. Its body produces a special scented substance called Pheromone, With the help ofthis, i attracts males for mating larly, pheromones are also used for the communication and to'ind out the location of hive. A queen bee lives the longest in the hive, about - years. Worker bees form a new queen by feeding royal jelly to the larva. Drone bee The drone bee is smaller than the queen but larger, blackish and hairy than the worker bee. It does not have sting, pollen basket, and wax-producing glands. Itis the laziest bee in the hive. It is even fed by worker bees. Its function is to fertilizethe queen bee. Drones are haploid. They have only chromosomes, but the queen and worker are diploid, having chromosomes. Drones are developed from unfertilized eggs. This process is called parthenogenesis. They only survive for about two months. Worker bee ‘They are the smallest size bee in the hive. They have a special body structure. Mouthparts are chewing and lapping type. Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade Worker bees are extremely hardworking. Their legs are densely covered withhair. Legs also possess pollen baskets. They collect pollen in the pollen basket and transport to the hive. The function of worker bees includes collecting nectar, constructing the hive, nursing young ones, protecting the hive, etc. About ,-, worker bees can be found in a hive. Life span of worker bees is about weeks to months. Question to think: Why do bee stings cause swelling? Life cycle of honey bee Activity .. Observation and study of the life cycle of the honey bee Materials required: Video or picture showing life cycle of the honey bee, clay, metacard, etc. Mothod Divide the class into four groups. ii, Watch the video of honey bee. ii, Study thoroughly and each group discuss one of the stages (egg, larva, pupa and adult) of life cycle of bee. Draw a picture on the metacard and note the characteristics. Also prepare a model of the life cycle of the honey bee using clay. iv. Paste the metacard and model prepared by each group on the board in sequential order. Present and discuss each stage in turn, Conclusion: Conclude the discussion on life cycle of the honey bee based on the presentation. All bees complete their life cycle in four stages- egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The duration of these stages varies according to the types of bees. To complete the life cycle, there occur two events- histolysis (degeneration of old tissues) and histogenesis Science and Tochnology, Grade (the formation of new tissues) in the larva and pupa. Because of these events, there is transformation of egg into larva, larva into pupa, and pupa into adult. This process is called complete metamorphosis. When there is an excess number of worker bees in a hive, the queen bee forms a new colony with a number of worker bees and eventually leaves the hive, Worker bees construct new hive. The worker bees in the old hive prepare a new queen by feeding a larva developed from a fertilized egg only with royal jelly. When the queen bee becomes adult, she leaves for the nuptial flight or mating flight. Usually, the queen bee leaves for the mating flight in the evening. When the queen bee leaves hive then she is followed by a group of drones. Queen bee mates with many drones, After mating, drones die. Queen bees receive sperms from drones which are used to fertilize millions of eggs. The structures used to store sperm in the body of the queen are called spermathecae. Drones die after mating because their genital organs are forcibly pulled during mating. After - days of mating, the queen bee starts laying eggs in the brood cell. Figure . Life cycle of honey bee Jarva co Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade Egg ‘The eggs of honey beeare white and elongated. Each egg lies erect within the brood cell on the first day, slanted on the second day, and horizontal on the third day. The queen bee lays eggs in drone cells to make drones, queen cells to make queens and worker cells, to make workers, She can lay eggs up to , per day under favourable conditions. The number of eggs varies with the types of bees. The duration of an ogg for all bees is three days. The size of an egg ranges from mm to . mm. There are two types of, eggs: fertilized and unfertilized. From fertilized eggs develop queen and worker bees. Drones develop from unfertilized eggs. Larva After three days of laying eggs, the eggs hatch into larvae.The larval stage lasts for about . days for queens, about days for workers,and about days for drones. The larva actively feeds in this stage. The larvae of future queens and drones are larger than the larvae of future workers. Queen and worker bees are both females developed from fertilized eggs. Whether a larva will be developed into a queen bee or a worker bee depends upon the type of food fed to the larvae. All larvae are fed royal jelly for three days. After that, the food type is changed according to the types of bee. The larvae that will become queen bees in the future continuously foed on nutritious royal jelly, but the larvae of future workers and drones feed on beebread after three days. Honey bread or bee bread is the mixture of honey and pollen. The larva moults for five times. As the food fed to the larvae is different, the uration of their developmental stage is also different. Scionco and Technology, Grade Pupa The pupa is an inactive phase in the life cycle of the bee in which it does not feed or move, but its structural changes are going on. In this phase, three pairs of legs, wings, and mouthparts are developed. The pupal stage lasts for days, days,and days for the queen, the worker, and the drone respectively. Adult After many changes, the pupa is transformed into an adult. The mandibles in the mouth of the newly formed adult bee chew the layer of wax sealed to the brood cell and emerge out. After they emerge, worker bees start helping others immediately. They have important tasks in the hive, such ascaring for brood cell, feeding larvae, and protecting the hive. 9g larva tava pupa pupa adult C day day day day day Figure .

Science and Tochnology, Grade Let us know Honey production Like royal jelly, honey is not produced from a particular gland inthe body of abee. Honey is a combination of monosaccharide sugars, especially fructose and glucose, which is prepared by evaporating as much water as possible from a mixture of different types of flower juice or nectar with the help of natural wind and the wind that blows when the worker bees flap their wings. It is composed of -% carbohydrates, -% water, .% protein, .% amino acids, vitamins, and other constituents. The colour, smell, and effectiveness of honey depend on the type of flowers from which the nectar is collected. Use of honey boo Honey bees are beneficial insects for the ecosystem, including human beings. Their benefits can be mentioned in the following points: a. Human beings are encouraged in various social behaviours by the hardworking nature, division of work, and high level, of disciple among honey bees. b. Highly nutritious honey is produced by bees, which is used in Ayurvedic medicine, candy, cake, bread, etc. While sucking nectar from flowers, pollination is carried out in plants. So honey bees have a role in the production of more crops in agriculture. d. Beeswax is widely used in cosmetics; for the manufacture of cream, lipstick, candles, etc. e.

Blood is composed of blood corpuscles and plasma and it flows in the single direction in our body due to the pressure created by the pumping action of heart. ‘Such a pressure created by heart is blood pressure which can be felt in the artery. Sometimes, blood pressure may behigh than the normal due to various factors. Various problems in the heart are because of high blood pressure and by the deposition of cholesterol on the wall of artery and the heart. There are various modem technologies for the treatment of heart problems. For example, Angioplasty, open heart bypass surgery, etc. There are four blood groups in human body which include A, B, AB, and O, and each group can be either Rh positive or Scionco and Technology, Grade oe Rh negative, hence there are altogether eight blood group including Rh positive and Rh nogative. . Human blood circulatory system: The blood circulatory system is ono of the nine systems in the human body. This system also connects with other systems. The chief organ of the blood circulatory system is the heart which pumps the blood collected from various parts of the body. The blood pumped by the heart flows through blood vessels and it reaches all cells of our body. It transports nutrients and inhaled oxygen to all the cells of the human body. Similarly, blood carries carbon dioxide produced in the colls to the lungs and other ‘wastes to excretory organs. Heart, blood vessels, and blood are the main parts of the circulator system. . Blood About . litres of blood is present in the body of a healthy adult person. Blood transports essential nutrients, oxygen, hormones, etc. to all the cells of the body. It also transports ‘unnecessary harmful wastes to the excretory organs. Blood is alkaline in nature, and its pH value ranges from .-.. Structure of blood Activity .

Based on observation, discuss the structure of blood inside the class. Blood is the red-coloured connective tissue that is a thick fluid. It consists of % plasma and % blood cells. Blood contains three types of blood corpuscles or blood cells. They are Red blood cells, White blood cells, and Platelets. Plasma Have you ever seen blood being collected after a goat is cut? After some time. the collected blood coagulates and is separated into a water-like liquid. This liquid part is known as plasma. It comprises % of total blood volume. Plasma is pale yellow — Figure5:.Composition ofbiooa coloured transparent liquid. It is composed of %-% water and -% dissolved substances such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, ind salts. Additionally, three types of proteins, namely albumen, slobulin, and fibrinogen are also found in plasma. Functions of plasma . Itregulates the amount of water in the blood. . It transports nutrients and unnecessary wastes from one place to another. . Plasma also transports enzymes and hormones secreted by glands to various parts of the bod: . Fibrinogen present in plasma helps in the clotting of blood. . Plasma regulates the temperature of our body. Scionco and Tochnology, Grade coy . Italso maintains the chemical composition of blood and its pH. . When fibrinogen is removed from plasma, it is called serum. Serum is used to diagnose various diseases. Blood corpuscles a. Red Blood Cell Red blood cells are red coloured, biconcave, round shaped and without nucleus. They are also called erythrocytes. These cells containa pigment called haemoglobin, which makes blood red. Haemoglobin is made up of iron and a protein called globin. Iron present in haemoglobin is responsible for the transportation of abundant oxygen to the cells. Haemoglobin also transports carbondioxide produced by the cells to the lungs. Haemoglobin combines with oxygen to form oxy- Number of red blood cells ranges frot about lakhs to lakhs per millimetre of blood. Their life span is - days. About lakhs red blood Figure Red blood cells colls are formed per second and the same number are destroyed. Red blood cells are formed in the bone marrow of spongy bone and are destroyed in the liver and spleen. A deficiency of red blood cells in the blood leads to a disease called anaemia. An anaemic person feels tired even after a short walk. Similarly, excess red blood cells in the blood causes a disease called polycythemia. The process of formation and destruction of red blood cells occurs in the body throughout life. Iron produced after the breakdown of old red blood cell is reused, b. White Blood Cell White Blood Cells have no definite shape but they are larger than red blood cells. They possess nucleus and other cellular components, but they do not have haemoglobin. They are also called leucocytes. White blood cells aro of two types: granular and non-granular. White blood cells that contain granules (non-living particles) in their cytoplasm are called granular leucocytes. Neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil are granular leucocytes. White blood cells that do not contain granules (non-living particles) in their cytoplasm are called non-granular leucocyte. Lymphocytes and monocytes are non-granular leucocytes. The lifespan of white blood cells Figure . White blood ces is about two weeks. Number of white blood cells ranges from about thousand to thousand per cubic millimetre of blood. They are formed in bone marrow and are destroyed in the spleen. When there is an abnormal increase in the number of white blood cells in the blood. then they destroy other blood cells, resulting in a disease called leukemia or blood cancer. White blood cells fight against disease-causing germs that enter the body from outside and destroy them. So, these cells are referred to as the soldiers of the human body. These cells increase the immunity of our body. An abnormal decrease of white blood cells leads to a disease called leukopenia. ©. Platelet Platelets are the smallest-sized, round, and non-nucleated blood cells in the human body. They are microscopic blood cells. Per cubic millimetre of blood contains about to lakhs platelets. They are formed in the red bone marrow. Their life span is about to days, and they are also destroyed in the spleen. Platelets combine with fibrinogen to clot blood during cut and injuries. Blood willnot clot even in small wounds or cuts the platelet count becomes low. This is called haemophilia. An abnormal increase of platelets in blood results in thrombocytosis, which causes heart attack and stroke. Figure . Platelets Scionco and Technology, Grade Functions of blood .

Antigon A and antigen B are found on the surface of RBC of blood. Human blood grouping is based on the inheritance of these red blood cells. On the basis of presence or absence of antigen on the red blood cell. blood is distinguished into different blood groups, such as A.B, AB and O. So. a human blood group may be type A. type B. type AB or type O. Blood which contains antigen A on the surface of red blood cell is called type A blood group. Type B blood group is the blood which contains antigen B. If the surface of RBC contains both. antigon A and antigen B, itis called type AB blood group. If the surface of RBC does not contain any antigen, antigen A or antigen B, then itis called type O blood group. Blood group O is the most common blood group in the world. Apart from antigen A and Antigen B. blood may also contain D antigen or Rhesus factor (Rh factor). Blood group is either positive or negative on the basis of presence or absence of D-antigen or Rh factor. If Rh factor is present. itis positive and if Rh factor is absent. it is negative blood group. If a person has blood group A+ve, his/her blood contains both the antigen A and Rh factor on the RBC. For example, if a person's blood does not contain any antigens. itis O-ve blood group. Blood group should be confirmed bofore blood transfusion. Ifa patient is given blood that does not match their blood type, intra-venous clumping can occur in the patient's blood which is fatal.

The heart is made up of cardiac ome Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade muscle and is situated inside the thoracic cavity, between two lungs. Itis slightly tilted towards the left side. ‘The heart is enclosed within a double-layered protective membrane called pericardium. The space between these two layers is filled with fluid, called pericardial fluid. It protects the heart from external shocks and injuries. The size of the human heart is the size of the owner's closed fist, and it weighs about grams on average. The heart is a triangular or conical muscular organ composed of cardiac muscles. It contracts and expands regularly to pump blood throughout the body. Blood is pumped through blood vessels and reaches each cell and tissues of body. About two-thirds of the heart lies to the left of thoracic cavity. A hair-like, very fine network of capillaries surrounds the heart. The coronary artery supplies oxygenated blood to the heart, while the coronary sinus vein transports deoxygenated blood to the right auricle of heart. ‘superior venacava \"i sorta ‘Pulmonary vein arene left auricle right Venticte left Ventre Figure . External structure of human heart Internal structure of the heart and blood circulation The human heart is four-chambered. The upper two chambers are called auricles or atria, while the lower two are called ventricles. There is a thick muscular septum in the middle of the heart that divides the heart into left and right parts and also prevents the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the heart. The four chambers Scionco and Technology, Grade in the heart are named right auricle, right ventricle, left auricle, and left ventricle. Blood vessels are connected to these chambers through which the heart supplies and receives blood. The auricles receive blood from various parts of the body. but the ventricles send blood to various body parts. The heart pumps blood to different part of the body with great pressure. To withstand such pressure, the walls of the ventricles are thicker than those of auricles. The right ventricle pumps blood only up to the lungs, but the left ventricle pumps blood to various organs with great pressure. Therefore, the wall of the left ventricle is thicker than the wall of the right ventricle. ‘The blood vessels that bring deoxygenated or impure blood to the right auricle of the heart are the superior vena cava and inferior vena cave ‘The superior vena cava brings impure blood from the upper parts of the body, while the inferior vena cava brings impure blood from the ower parts of the body. When the auricles contract. impure blood from the right auricle is passed to the right ventricle, and pure blood from the left auricle to the left ventricle. The pulmonary artery transports deoxygenated blood to the hungs for oxygenation, while the pulmonary voin transports oxygenated blood to the left auricle of the heart. The only artery that transports oxygenated blood in the human body is the pulmonary artery. and the vein that transports oxygenated blood the pulmonary vein. After the pure blood is passed from the left auricle to the left ventricle, blood from the left ventricle is pumped to various parts of the body through the aorta. There are four valves in the heart. The valve situated between the right auricle and right ventricle of the heart is called the tricuspid valve. By opening this valve, blood passes from the right auricle to the right ventricle. The valve situated between the left auricle and loft ventricle of the heart is called the bicuspid valve or mitral valve. Pure blood from the left auricle flows to the left ventricle by opening this valve. Both valves open simultaneously when the auricles contract together, and the contraction of the auricles is followed by the contraction of both ventricles. When the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve is closed, and the pulmonic valve between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery opens, and deoxygenated blood is pumped to the lungs through the pulmonary artery for oxygenation. cy Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade Similarly, when the left ventticle contracts, the bicuspid valve is closed, and the aortic valve between the aorta and left ventricle opens, and oxygenated blood is pumped to the various organs of the body through the aorta. ‘superior venacava pulmonary vein right auricle pulmonary valve tricuspia valve inferior venacava Figure interna structure ofthe human heart . Heart attack In general, the process that continues in the heart is blood coming to the heart from various parts of the body, and blood going to various organs from the heart. But sometimes, the flow of blood to the heart tissues is suddenly reduced or blocked, and in this situation, the heart cannot do its work properly, and the person feels extreme difficulty. This condition is called heart attack. Figure . Condition of a heart attack ‘This is a serious and emergency condition. sant This problem may arise when the coronary artery that supplies pure blood to the heart becomes narrower due to the excess deposition of fat or cholesterols on the inner wall of the artery. Such a deposit of fat or cholesterol on the inner wall of the artery is called plaque. ‘Sometimes, these plaques break down and form thrombi, which may also block capillaries. damaging certain tissues of the heart. A heart attack is also called myocardial infarction, and immediate treatment is required to save the life of a person suffering from a heart attack. Risk factors of heart attack Age Male above years and female above years of age are at the risk of heart attack than the youths. Consumption of tobacco product Chewing tobacco and its products and smoking cigarettes are also the causes of heart attack. High blood pressure or hypertension A person whose blood pressure is high for a long time is also at the risk of heart attack. High cholesterol and triglycerides Arteries become narrower due to the deposition of high level of bad cholesterol on their inner wall. Such cholesterol resists the flow of blood through the artery and increases the chance of a heart attack. ‘Similarly. high levels of triglycerides in the blood also increase the tisk of heart attack. Diabetes Diabetes is a disorder in which blood sugar level increases in the body. This condition also increases the risk of heart attack. om Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade Family history If someone has a family history of heart attack. s/he is also at risk of heart attacks. Lack of regular exercise and unhealthy diet Consumption of foodstuffs containing more trans-fat, salt, and sugar, animal fat, and processed foods and lack of regular exercise also increases the risk of a heart attack. Stressful life Emotional stress, like excessive anger or excessive negative thin etc, also increases the risk of a heart attack. Consumption of illegal drugs Habits such as taking drugs like cocaine and amphetamines as stimulants affect the coronary artery and increase the chance of heart attack, ‘Symptoms of a heart attack ‘Symptoms of a heart attack vary among people. General symptoms of a heart attack are given below: ‘a. Sudden pain and discomfort in the centre of the chest which slowly spreads to shoulder, hand, neck, jaw, and sometimes the stomach b. Cold sweat, fatigue, shortness of breath. ©. Headache or sudden dizziness, nausea . Some people have sudden heart attacks. But most people experience warning signs of a heart attack a few hours, days, cor woeks earlier. such as: regular discomfort or pressure in the chest region that does not get reduced even after taking a rest. These are the initial symptoms and insufficient blood flow to the heart tissues may be the cause of discomfort in the heart. Scionco and Technology, Grade oy Preventive measures a.

Diagnosis of heart attack and treatment For the diagnosis of a heart attack, the blood pressure, pulse, and temperature are checked. Diagnosis also involves overall tests related to the heart, heartbeat, etc. ‘A heart attack is tested using various techniques, including Electrocardiogram. blood test. Echo, Angiography. CT Coronary Angiogram, and MRI. Angiography Angiography is a type of fluoroscopy X-ray used to test blockages in blood vessels. In general. X-ray images of blood vessels are not viewed clearly. However, in this process, a special dve called contrast medium is injected into the blood. This process highlights blood flow and provides a clear view of problems in blood vessels. The X-ray image formed in angiography is called angiogram, During a heart attack, many tissues of the heart are destroyed per minute. So, immediate treatment is essential to restore blood flow and oxygen levels. For this, immediate supply of oxygen to the patient is required. Especially, the treatment of a heart attack depends on whether there is a partial or complete blockage of blood flow. The a Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade patient should be immediately taken to the hospital for treatment, where doctors’ instructions are followed. In general. when angiogram and angioplasty equipment are not available, doctors start treatment by using blood thinners. In places where angiogram and angioplasty aro available, a surgical procedure is required to open the blocked artery. Medical procedures such as Coronary angioplasty and stenting, coronary artery bypass surgery. etc., are used to open blocked arteries. Coronary angioplasty and stenting This medical procedure is used to open the clogged coronary artery of the heart, also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). During angioplasty, a cardiologist puts a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel of the hand or leg and guides it to the narrowed artery of the heart. A stent (a small metal mesh tube) is often placed during angioplastv. The stent halns to onen narrowed or blocked blood vessels and n ow. The stont widens the blood vessels and : itis coated with a medicine.

Heart beat, pulse rate or heart rate A heartbeat is the sound of the heart due to the regular and rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle. Heartbeat varies with the physical condition of the body. A stethoscope is the device used to measure heartbeat. At resting condition, heartbeat of a healthy adult person is - times per minute. This is called the heart rate. A slow heartbeat, which is less than times per minute, is called bradycardia or slow heart. A fast heartbeat, which is more than times per minute, is called tachycardia or fast heart. Because of the regular and rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle, blood is pumped to various cells and tissues through arteries. While blood is flowing through the artery, the pressure exerted by blood on arteries can be felt from the outside. This is called the pulse. In general, heart rate and pulse rate are equal. So, these terms are used synonymously. Ina healthy adult person, the normal pulse rate ranges from to times per minute. With the help of the fingers placed on the throat or arm, pulse rate of a person can be folt. Activity . Measurement of the pulse rate Objective: To measure pulse rate . Sit in a normal posture, .

Record the pulse rates of your classmates in the same ‘manner. Compare the data and discuss. . Similarly, place your finger on the carotid artery located beneath your lower jaw and measure your pulse rate. ae Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade Figure . Blood vessel Blood vessels are the flexible, muscular tubes which transport blood to various cells and tissues of the body. Arteries, veins, and capillaries are the three types of blood vessels. Artery ven ‘Sood fom eee! nd oe Heat Figure . Types of blood vessels Artery The blood vessel that transports blood from heart to the various parts of the body is called an artery. Arteries are highly muscular blood vessels, Such muscular wall helps to withstand the pressure of blood. There are no valves in arteries. The aorta is the largest artery in the human body. and it divides to give off numerous small arteries. Arteries, in turn, divide to give off arterioles. Each arteriole, again. divides to form a fine network of blood capillaries. Capillaries Arterioles divide to form a network of fine, thread-like or hair-like Scionco and Tochnology, Grade a blood vessels called capillaries. Blood capillaries supply nutrients, oxygen, hormones, enzymes, etc. dissolved in blood to the cells and receives the wastes like carbon dioxide, urea and other unnecessary substances produced in the cells to transport them up to excretory organs. After receiving wastes from the coll, capillaries unite subsequently to form venules and veins. Vein The blood vessel which transports blood from various organs of the body to the heart is called vein. Their wall is composed of three lavers as found in artery but they havo a thinner layer of smooth muscles. So veins are thin-walled blood vessels. Veins carry carbon dioxide and waste-rich blood collected by venules to the heart, so there is less speed and pressure of blood in veins and also the probability of blood flow in reverse direction. To prevent the blood flow in the opposite direction, veins have valves at frequent intervals. Venules, veins, and venacava have the same function, but their size differs and numbers. . Blood circulation The process by which blood is transported from the heart to various body parts and from the various body parts to the heart is called blood circulation. The heart pumps about - litres of blood per minute in an adult human. The circulation of blood in the human body can be divided into two ways: , Systemic blood circulation , Pulmonary blood circulation ‘Systemic blood circulation ‘The process of blood circulation in which oxygenated blood from the left ventricle flows through the aorta and its branches (arteries) to various parts of the body, and the deoxygenated blood from these organs returns to the heart through veins is called systemic circulation, When the left ventricle contracts. pure blood flows from the heart into the aorta. From the aorta to the small arteries and arterioles, blood reaches to the cells through capillaries. In this way, nutrients, oxygen and other essential substances are supplied to each cell of Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade the body. When these substances aro utilized in the cells, carbon dioxide gas and other wastes are produced, which are then transported by blood through voins. These veins, in turn, unite to form the venacava, and hence blood rich in carbon dioxide (impure blood) is transported to the right auricle through the vvenacava. In this way, the process in which blood from the left vontricle goes to various parts Figure Bioad circulation through arteries and then returns totheright auricle through veins is called systemic blood circulation. artory vein left Ventricle different parts of body» right auricle Pulmonary blood circulation The circulation of blood between the heart and lungs through the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins is called pulmonary circulation. When the right ventricle contracts, the pulmonic valve opens and deoxygenated blood (carbon dioxide-rich blood) flows through the pulmonary artery and finally through the capillaries network surrounding the millions of alveoli of the lungs. Then, carbon dioxide is left in the alveoli where oxygen is picked up by the blood, which becomes pure or oxygenated. The pure blood is carried to the left auricle through the pulmonary veins. Therefore, the process in which impure blood flows from the right ventricle to the lungs and pure blood flows from the lungs to the left auricle of the hearts called pulmonary blood circulation. pulmonary artery pulmonary vein right Ventricle Jungs loft auricle Scionco and Technology, Grade = . Blood pressure When the left ventricle contracts and pumps pure blood into arteries, pressure is exerted on the inner walls of the arteries. Such pressure created by the blood on the wall of blood vessels, especially arteries, is called blood pressure. Blood pressure depends on the size of the blood vessel. blood flow, the amount of blood, and the force created during ventricular contraction. Blood pressure is measured in the unit “mmlig’. Blood pressure is expressed in two values or readings. The ‘upper reading or value is systolic blood pressure, which is created due to the ventricular contraction. The lower value or reading is diastolic blood pressure, which is created due to ventricular relaxation or when the ventricle comes to its original position. Systolic blood pressure in an adult is 90mmHg to mmHg, Similarly, diastolic pressure in an adult person is GOmmHg to 90mmHg, Nowadays, blood pressure is also measured by digital methods. The device used to measure the blood pressure of a human is called a sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure depends on the mental state. age, sex, and physical state of an individual. The normal blood pressure of an adult person is / mmHg, where mmiig is systolic blood pressure and mmHg is diastolic blood pressure. High blood pressure or hypertension If the blood pressure of an individual exceeds / mmHg, such a condition is called high blood pressure or hypertension. Symptoms of high blood pressure are given below: a. Headache, shortness of breath b. Nose bleeding c. Sweating, fatigue d. Face becomes red e. Sleeplessness, anxiety Causes of high blood pressure Blood pressure is caused due to various reasons. Some are mentioned below: Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade a. Lack of regular physical exercise b.

Generally, the climate of a place remains similar. Very small natural changes on Earth do not change climate. However, due to the emission of different types of greenhouse gases by human activities, the climate of the world has changed. As a result, the weather patterns of various regions have changed a lot. fochnology, Grado coy Climate change Climate change is a serious global problem, and developing countries are more affected by it than developed ones. Nepal's contribution to greenhouse gas emission is negligible, yet it is at a high risk of adverse effects of climate change. In addition to the natural up and down of the climate over a long period of time, there has been a gradual change in the Earth's climate due to changes in the composition of the atmosphere caused by direct or indirect human activities. The process of change in climate in the particular place in the long interval of time due to unstable nature and various human activities is called climate change. During climate change, the regular cycle of weather of a place is disturbed. Overall, climate change refers to a change in the statistical magnitude of the weather over a long period of time. Scientists around the world have studied climate change and its effects by analysing various sources such as weather data, satellite images, and research reports of the places affected by climate change. Climate change is also experienced in Nepal. Since the past, the temperature of Nepal is increasing at the rate of .°C every year. Various water sources, like rivers, lakes, and fountains, are drying up every year, and the volume of water in rivers is decreasing. There is an equal chance of flooding due to glacial lake outbursts. Heights of mountains are decreasing due to the melting of snow. Based on all these facts, it can be said that climate change has a negative impact in Nepal as well. Causes of climate change ‘The causes of climate change include both natural factors and human-induced activities. Due to poverty, illiteracy, and social inequality, the livelihoods of communities that depend on natural resources are considered more sensitive to the impact of climate change. Causes of climate change can be classified into two: natural and human-induced. Natural cause Various natural phenomena influence the environment. The emission of greenhouse gases takes place because of such natural Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade events, and consequently, climate change occurs. Some natural activities are given below: a. — Solar activities Energy is produced in the sun because of thermonuclear fusion reactions. When the rate of this reaction changes. the energy produced in the sum also changes. This also affects the intensity of solar radiations that come on the surface of the earth. Such changes affect the weather. So, such variations in solar activities have a role in climate change. b. Change in the reflectivity of the earth ‘The amount of solar radiation reflected from the earth depends on the nature of the earth's surface and atmosphere. About % of the solar radiation that reaches the earth is absorbed. It contributes to the natural changes on the surface of the earth like melting of ice due to climate changes. Greenhouse gases include water vapour too, which is formed due to the evaporation from seas, rivers, and other water sources. Fluctuation in the amount of light and heat radiations of the sun on the earth’s surface results in a change in the rate of evaporation. ©. Volcanic eruption Volcanoes have played a noticeable role in the climate. During volcanic eruptions, various gases, including carbon dioxide and aerosols, are emitted. Such gases and aerosols spread high up to the upper layer of the atmosphere and block solar radiation forsome time, making the earth’s surface cold. In addition, emitted greenhouse gases in such cases remain in the atmosphere for a long time trapping the solar radiations and increasing the temperature of the earth.

Production of greenhouse gasos While burning fossil fuels like coal, miner oil, natural gases to produce heat energy and electrical energy, a tremendous amount of harmful gases, including greenhouse gases, are produced. This process also contributes to the increase in the temperature of the earth’s surface. b. — Industrialization Different types of industries are established to produce cement, steel, electrical appliances, plastic clothes, and other materials. Fossil fuels are used to run such industries. Gases released by the combustion of such fuels pollute the environment and also play role in climate change. Figure . Factory ©.

This increases global warming. The forest is the main storage site of carbon emitted into the environment. Sconce and Tachnalogs d. Burning of fossil fuels Fossil fuels are used in most of the vehicles like cars, buses, planes, ships, trucks, etc. While burning such fuels, harmful as well as greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide, are released. These gases pollute the environment and also increase the temperature of the earth. Figure . Vehicles Effects of climate change Activity . Divide the students into several groups as per the need, collect photos and details of the effects of climate change on the mountains, hills, and terai by using the internet and newspapers, and then prepare a poster. Display the poster in class and discuss the effects of climate change on the environment and human life. Over the past few decades, the rise in atmospheric temperature and the resulting climate-related disasters, like either extreme rainfall, no rainfall or drought, have adversely affected the Himalayan range and glaciers of Nepal, as well as the ecosystems dependent on them. Due to the rapid melting of snow caused by the rising temperature of the earth, the size of glacial lakes is increasing, and the risk of glacial lake outburst is also increasing. The negative impacts of climate change have been directly felt in areas related to livelihoods, such as forests and biodiversity, energy sources, human health, tourism, housing, and infrastructure development. Climate-related disasters, such as floods, landslides, and forest fires, have also caused the loss of a large amount of property every year. The effects of climate change are described below Drought and floods Climate change brings the changes in the availability or pattern of rainfall in various areas, leading to the possibility of drought Scionco and Technology, Grade cy in some areas and floods in others due to excess rainfall. Drought and floods affect agricultural production, which increases the risk of food crisis in the future. b. Increasing sea lovel An excess amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere results in an increase in the temperature of the atmosphere, leading to changes in the climate. This overall rise in temperature of the earth is called global warming. This rise in temperature also causes an increase in the volume of seawater. Besides, water formed by the melting of snow due to global warming also contributes to the rise of sea level. As a result, waterlevels reach the top of coasts and islands, destroying flora, fauna, and their habitats, and affecting local communitis ©. Effects on biodiversity The increment in the earth's temperature caused by climate change brings changes in the life processes of organisms living on land and seas. These changes affect their growth, development, and physiology. Climate change also affects the adaptation of, animal and plant species found in land and marine forms. As a result, the risk of extinction of those organisms increases. d. Negative impact on human health Climate change adversely affects various environmental components. This also impacts on human health. It causes hazards in humans, like skin diseases, mental illnesses, nal deficiencies, etc. fe. Change in weather Due to climate change, there has also been a change in the ‘weather. Heavy rainfall occurs in seasons other than rainy season. Sometimes, there is drought during the rainy season. As a result, agricultural farming is affected because sometimes there is heav rainfall and no rainfall when needed, and often there is too much rainfall for the crops that can easily grow with little water.

According to the Environmental Protection Act , the government of Nepal, provincial government, local level, and other public bodies and the private sector can issue necessary orders by publishing notices in the Nepal Gazette regarding measures to de adopted to mitigate the adverse effects and risks of climate change. Various negative impacts are seen on the earth due to climate change. To control climate change, it is necessary to adopt measures to minimize it. Some measures are given below: . Reducing carbon emission Global warming is increasing due to the excessive emission of carbon. Climate change can be controlled by reducing the amount of carbon emissions. For this, energy efficiency should be improved and emphasis should be given to the use and conservation of energy resources. Priority should be given to the use of alternative energy sources like solar energy and wind energy in transportation. This can reduce fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions. b. Emphasizing in carbon storage Green plants utilize carbon dioxide to prepare their food and release oxygen into the environment, which is essential for organisms. So, emphasis should be given to the conservation of, forest resources through plantation and the conservation of trees. This way more carbon can be stored within plants, helping to minimize the climate change. Scionco and Technology, Grade oy c.

Among them, some important plants are Jatamasi, Champ, Sarpagandha, Panch aule, Lauth Salla, etc., which have been decreasing. These plants are used by human for various purposes, but because they are being used without considering their status, they are going to be extinct in the near future, Therefore, protection of these plants is a must. Various efforts have been made to protect them. The Government of Nepal has implemented the “Control of International Trade of Endangered Wild Fauna and Flora Act, ” for the conservation of rare wild animals and plants. This act includes various rules related to controlled breeding, study research, and sales distribution of, rare wild animals and planis. Some conservation measures for protecting rare plants are as follows: a, Conservation of natural habitat Collecting firewood, fodder leaves, and grasses from the forest, forest fires, and the extension of pasture land lead to the loss or destruction of natural habitats of wildlife. These activities should be controlled. Rare plants can be conserved by the protection of their natural habitat. Haphazardly grazing of cattle in the forest. area should be stopped by humans. Besides, such places should be identified and conserved. b. Conservation of rare and endangered plants ‘The varieties of raw materials required for conducting different types of industries and factories are obtained from different types of plants. While collecting such raw materials, the existence and protection of useful plants should be kept in mind. They should not be destroyed in such a way that they cannot be produced again. Their theft and smuggling should be controlled. Increasing the production of saplings through modern methods to expand the number of rare plants To increase the number of rare plants, their seed should be collected and grown in a nursery. Modern techniques like tissue cs Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade culture can also be adopted to produce many saplings at a time. ‘After that, afforestation of rare and useful plants can be widely done. . Formulation and implementation of appropriate laws Rules and laws should be made to conserve plants that are about to go extinct and those that are prone to extinction. The information regarding laws should be spread to the public and should be implemented effectively. Medicinal use and conservation of rare plants It is necessary to make the public aware that most of the rare plants can be used for medicinal purposes. Public awareness raising programs about the rare plants should be organized at the local level. Local people, communities, and organizations should be mobilized for protecting rare plants. . Measures of conservation of wildlife Due to various human-induced and natural causes, fauna is endangered, extinct, and becomes rare. Various fauna or animals are at the danger of extinction due to the change in the ecosystem, destruction of habitat, adverse effects on the environment, poaching and illegal trade. To control the illegal hunting and trade of wildlife, the “Control of International Trade of Endangered Wild Fauna and Flora Act, ” has been implemented by the government.

Here, when the product of two ‘masses increases four times, the gravitational force is also increased by four times. That is, when the distance is kept constant, the gravitational force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects. Similarly. when the distance between two spheres is doubled. the gravitational force is found to be reduced by four times. That is, when the mass is kept constant, the gravitational force isinversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects. The collective conclusions of activity . are included in Newton's universal law of gravitation, According to this law, the gravitational force produced between any two objects in the universe is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, As shown in figure ., let the mass of the objects A and B be m'andm respectively, the distance between the conters of these two objectsbe d, and the gravitational force produced between ‘Fig . twomasses them be F.

However, when the ball is dropped from a certain height, the Earth does not move upwards, but only the ball appears to fall towards the Earth. Why? Using Newton's second laws of motion, calculate the acceleration produced by that force on the sphere with a mass of kg and on the Earth with a mass of . x % kg. Variation in grav jonal force with mass and distance The change in gravitational force observed in activity . can be explained mathematically by using the formula used to calculate the gravitational force.

Similarly, by increasing the mass of both objects by times, the gravitational force increases by times. Putting y ; Te equation Pike. d= = tnogaton If the distance between the two objects is halved, while keeping tho mass constant, tho gravitational force between the two objects increases by times. Similarly, if the distance between two objects is increased by two times, the gravitational force between those two objects decreases by four times. Consequences of gravitational force ‘Some of the consequences of gravitational forces are presented below: (a) Gravitational force has made the existence of the universe including the solar system possible. The gravitational force between the sun and the planets causes the planets to revolve around the sun. (b) Since the Moon is closer than the Sun to the Earth, itis important even though it has a very small mass compared to the Sun. The effect of the moon's gravitation is more visible on seawater than ‘on land, due to which tides are created. (c) Gravitational forces between the earth and the objects on its surface make the objects stick to the surface of the earth. Als an object is thrown vertically upwards, the object will fall back on the surface. Gravity Earth and other planets and satellites are pulling their nearby objects towards their centers. The force exerted by the planet or satellite on nearby objects is often called the force of gravity. It is also called the weight of the object. According to Newton's universal law of gravitation, the force of gravity decreases with increasing height from the planet and becomes negligible at a certain distance. Therefore, Earth and other planets/satellites have a definite gravitational field. We observe many effects of Earth's gravity in our daily life. Some of these effects are mentioned below: (a) All objects have the weight due to gravity. (b) Earth is surrounded by the atmosphere due to gravity. (c) Objects dropped from a certain height fall towards the center of the Earth due to its gravity. (a) Due to the effect of gravity, water in rivers and streams flows downwards. (c) Force of gravity causes acceleration in a falling object. Acceleration due to gravity Activity . Calculation of acceleration due to gravity Take a small stone and a stopwatch. Drop the stone from different heights (e.g., first sounds floor. second floor of a building). Drop the stone in such a way that no downward force is applied by the fingers on the lestance ‘ound? stone,i.e.,just release the stone from the hand by loosening the fingers. Tell a friend to record the time taken by the stone to reach the ground using a stop watch. preeb epoca om Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade Using the data so obtained and equations of motion sh=ur+-+- af? = aly calculate the acceleration and velocity (final velocity v) of the stone when it hits the ground.While calculating, take the initial velocity of the stone (u) = . A table like the one below can be used for data collection and necessary calculations. First time arate, [Y= Vany Second time v=vah,y ‘Third time v= V(2ah,) In activity ., the object released from the hand is set in motion due to the earth’s gravity, and it acts constantly throughout the motion. The more the object falls. the faster its velocity will be. Increasing the velocity of the object means it is accelerating. Thus. acceleration gots produced in the body falling frecly towards the earth's surface because of gravity. In activity .. the acceleration of a falling stone is .8m/swhen the air resistance is negligiblei.e., almost zero. Such. n is the acceleration due to the gravity of the earth. The acceleration produced in a freely falling object due to the force of gravity is called acceleration due to gravity. It is denoted by 'g’ and its SI unit is moter per second squared (ms). ‘Question to think Does the acceleration due to gravity vary according to the mass of the falling object? Activity . Take a small stone and a sheet of paper. Tear the sheet of paper into two equal parts. Squeeze one of them tightlyinto a ball shape. Drop the sheet of torn paper. a paper ball and a stone together and observe which one reaches the ground first. Do the sheet of paper.the paper ball and the stone fall at different velocities? If this activity was done ‘on the moon, what would be the result? In this activity, the sheet of paper and the paper ball having the same mass fall at different velocities, but the paper ball and the stone having different masses fall together. Thus, the rate of change in the velocity of an object falling towards the surface of the earth is not related to its mass. When a sheet of paper falls in the air, the air resistance exerts an upward force on it and the velocity decreases, but in the case of paper ball and stone, the air resistance is negligible and they fall together towards the center of the earth only under the influence of gravity. Since there is no atmosphere on the surface of the moon, all objects fall freely without obstruction. In such a situation, all objects fall with the same acceleration (acceleration due to gravity), If sheot of paper ! and the paperball, as mentioned [/ Falling of objects win aiferent in activity ., are dropped together on the surface of the moon, they both fall together According to the laws of motion propounded by Aristotle, who was born in Greece in BC, heavier objects fall before lighter ones. This law was disproved by Galileo's experiment in the seventeenth century. Around the vear BC, Galileo dropped two balls together from the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy and found that both balls hit the ground together. He concluded that all freely falling bodies fall with the same acceleration due to gravity. This was later proved by the feather- and coin experiment. Feather and coin experiment vem In Figure ., a glass cylinder is connected to a vacuum pump. A feather and a coin are placed at its bottom. When the cylinder is turned upsidedown in the presence ofair inside it, the coin falls faster than the feather If the air is pumped out using the vacuum pump and the cylinder is tured upside down, th coin and the feather are seen to fall together. feta om Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade ‘The cause of the coin and feathernot falling together the first time is the presence of air resistance inside the cylinder. Since the surface area of the feather is greater than that of the coin, the air resistance acting on the feather is greater than acting on the coin and acceleration is reduced. So the feather falls slower than the coin. The second time, as there is no air inside the cylinder i.e. there is no air resistance, both the feather and the coin fall together. In the absence of air resistance, the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects. That is, the value of 'g' does not depend on the mass of the falling body. Calculation of acceleration due to gravity ‘Suppose a body of mass 'm' is on the surface of a planet of mass 'M’ and radius 'R’. If the force of gravity of the planet acting on the body is ‘F the gravitational force produced between them is, re If this force produces acceleration ‘g' in mass ‘m’, then from the Second Jaw of motion, F= mg coven (ii) From the equations (i) and (ii), GM According to equation (iti) the acceleration depends only on the mass °M and radius 'R’of the planet. Since the mass of the falling object is not included in the equation, it confirms the fact that all the masses have the same acceleration when they fall freely, just like the results of Galileo's activity and feather- coin experiment. In non-spherical planets or satellites like Earth, the value of radius 'R’ changes depending on location. In equation (iii) both G and M are constants. In this case, the acceleration due to gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the radius of the planet or satellite. Hence, ex ® Scionco and Technology, Grade am Acceleration due to gravity depends upon both the mass and the radius of the planet or satellite. For example, the mass of Jupiter is about times the mass of the Earth, but its acceleration value is only . times the acceleration due to the gravity of the Earth. The radius of Jupiter has a main role to play in this. The radius of Jupiter is times the radius of the Earth. Since the acceleration due to gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the radius, even though the ‘mass of Jupiter is very large, the net effect on the acceleration due to gravity will be only +e = . times gre: On substituting the mass of the earth as . x10\" and the radius as km in equation (iii), . x10\" x x10\" \" g , ( x10)\" . x % = Blin/s Since the value of R changes in different places on the earth, the value of acceleration due to gravity is also found to be different. Variation in acceleration due to gravity of the earth ‘The earth is not perfectly round. It is slightly - flattened at the poles and bulged in the equatorial region. Hence, as shown in Figure .. the radius of the Earth is less towards the poles and more towards the equator. Since tho value of the accoleration due to gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the radius of the earth, its value is more at the = poles than at the equator. The value of 'g' in Figure . Earth's radius the equatorial region is . m/s and . m/ sin the polar region. As the value of 'g' is higher in the polar region, ‘objects fall faster in the polar region than in the equatorial region. The average value of 'g' on earth is considered to be .81m/s. This ‘means that the velocity of a freely falling body toward the surface of the earth increases by . meter per second. In contrast, the velocity of a body projected vertically upwards decreases by .81meter per second. The velocity becomes zero at the maximum height that it a” and then. it returns to the earth. Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade Height and acceleration due to gravity Activity . Comparison of the acceleration due to gravity with increasing distance from the center of the earth a=aR eomter of the earth (d) ‘Reoeleration due to gravity Ditterent distances from center of the Earth x = m/s! As shown in Figure ., when d = R is the distance from the center of the earth, the value of the acceleration due to gravity, g,=-™ m/s Other distance d = 2R, 3R, 4R from the center of the earth are also shown in the same figure. In the table along with the figure, the value of acceleration due to gravity at a distance d = 2R is calculated. Likewise, calculate andcompare the values of acceleration due to gravity that occurs as the distance from the center of the earth goes on increasing. As the height above the surface of the earth creases, the value of the acceleration due to gravity decreases. Suppose, a satelite at a hoight h from the surface of the earth is orbiting the earth. ‘The value of the acceleration dug to the gravity of the earth at that height his g,= %. The value of = acceleration due to the gravity ofthe earth's surface <M tnthis case, the distance ofthesatellite — WW\"\"? from the center of the earth is d= R+h. Since the value of (R+h} is greater than the value of R°, the value of gt is less than that of g. Example . ‘The mass of the earth is . x %kg and its radius is km. Calculate the acceleration due to the gravity of the International Space Station situated at an altitude of km above the surface of the earth. According to the information given in the question, Mass of Earth (M) =. x10 kg Radius of Earth (R) = km= m Height of International Space Station above the surface of Earth (h)= km = m The acceleration due to gravity at that height, om (Reh)? =, x10\" . x10\" on = “( +) .\" . x10\" . x10\" Therefore, the acceleration due to the gravity of the International Space Station at an altitude of km is .66m/s. Since, the distance of the top of a hill from the center of the earth is greater than the distance (radius, R) of its bottom from the center of the earth, the value of 'g’ is less at the top of the hill than that at its bottom. But such a difference is very small. For example, the height of Mt. Everest is . m. The distance from the center of the earth to the peak of Mt.

Bb. The value of the acceleration of gravity of the moon is about times less than that of the earth. Mass and weight The weight of an object is related to the acceleration due to gravity. The total quantity of matter present in an object is its mass. This is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit is the kilogram (kg). No matter wherever a1 kg mass of iron is kept either on Earth orthe International Space Station or the Moon or Mars, ete., the quantity of iron in it is alway kg. Therefore, the value of the mass of an object does not change according to the place. Like the smallest particle, an electron also has a definite mass. The value of mass is not zero. Similarly, even the smnallest mass experiences the force of gra Earth's gravity pulls objects on its surface toward its center. Science and Tochnology, Grade the planet/satellite because it is the force of gravity, According to Newton's second law of ne motion, the force of gravity acting on {/gufe,/ , Meapurement of an object of mass 'm, Le., weight. is W = mg. where g is the acceleration due to gravity. The weight of an object dependson the object's mass and acceleration due to gravity. Since the earth's gravity pulls every object towards its center, a force atleast equal to the force of gravity is to be applied in the upward direction to lift any object from the surface. Depending on the relationship between mass and weight, different forces are required to lift small and lange objects. Since the value of acceleration due to gravity at a place remains constant, the weight of the object varies according to its mass. In this case, the weight of the object (W) is directly proportional to its mass (m). ie..Weight (W) & Mass (in) [Keeping the value of g constant]. Therefore. objects with greater mass weigh more than objects with lesser mass. Hence, more force must be applied to lift an object with ‘a groator mass than an object with a smaller mass. Also, it is easier to lift small stones thanbig ones. Variation in weight due to change of acceleration due to gravity The difference in weight for a definite mass depends on the force of gravity. Thus, the weight of an object is directly proportional to the acceleration due to gravity, ie., Weight (W) & Acceleration due to gravity(g) [Keeping mass constant] Since the value of 'g! on Earth changes according to the location, the weight of the object also changes. Activity .: Comparison of the weight of an object at different places om Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade Weight is the measure of the force of gravity acting on an object. Since weight is the force exerted on an eorieg object, its SI unit is the newton (N). This is a vector quantity.

At a place on the earth's surface where the value of acceleration due to gravity is maximum, the weight of an object is also maximum at that place. Acceleration du tothe gravity of the moon (gm esx timos that of the earth (ge). ie. , «-, Therefore, the weight of an object of a definite mass on Earth’is almost times the weight of the same object on the moon, Therefore, ono can jump about times higher on the moon than on the Earth, On the moon, a person should be able to lift about times the massas much as he/she can on the earth. Therefore, while comparing the acceleration due to the gravity ofthe Earth and other planets/ satellites, it can also be concluded that the ‘weight of an object on those planets/ satellites is also different.

Orm=——£ = . m= . kg Therefore, a person who can lift kg on Earth can lift . kg on the surface of the Moon. Free fall As observed in activity ., a sheet of paper and a falling stone can be considered as free fall when the air resistance on them is negligible. In that case, the acceleration of the stone is equal to the acceleration of gravity (. m/s) ofthe earth. Thus, an object falling under the influence of gravity alone without any obstruction is said to be in free fall. The acceleration of an object in free fall is equal to the acceleration due to gravity (g). According to the structure of the objects falling into the earth's atmosphere, the frictional force on them creates a resistanceto their motion. The upthrust on a falling object also helps reduce the effect co Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade of the force of gravity. Thus, the actual free fall is possible only in ‘ vacuum. Since there is no resistanceof the atmosphere to a falling body on the moon, free fall is possible. Activity . Making a model of a parachute Take scissors, a thin plastic sheet and thread. Stretch the plastic in different steps and cut it into a circular shape as shown in Figure .. Tie equal pieces of thread at equal distances around the edges of the circular plastic. Tie the open section of the threads in a single knot and attach a toy or stone to it. Drop the prepared parachute model froma height. Observe its fall. Does the parachute fall at a high speed at the beginning and with a uniform speed at the last? T =. Kw Figure . Construction of a model ofa parachute ‘Question to think Is it possible to land safely on the moon using a parachute like on the Earth? VSS While jumping with a parachute, the air resistance increases with the speed of the parachute. This process leads to a situation where weight and air resistance become equal. In such conditions, the acceleration of the falling parachute becomes zero. Then the parachute falls towards the ground with a uniform speed. A safe landing on the ground is possible due to the uniformspeed of the parachute. This Kind of parachute fall is not a free fall. Atmospheric resistance is necessary for a safe landing with a parachute. Since the moon does not contain such resistance,jumping, ‘towards its surface with a parachute isa free fall. Asa result, the speed increases continuously and lands on the surface at high speed. Thus, « safe landing on the moon using a parachute is not possible. ‘When hail falls on the earth's surface from a certain height, it falls ata certain constant speed instead of increasing continuously. It is due to the resistance offered by the air. It reduces the damage caused by hail on the earth's surface. The resistance or friction caused by the ‘wind on the hail creates an upward drag force. The faster the hail falls. the greater the resisting force acting on it. When the force of gravity acting on the hail and the frictional force acting on it become equal, the hail falls at a constant speed. ‘As shown in Figure ., a wind-dispersed seed contains a structure like a fur and a small fan, They worklike small parachutes. When these types of seeds are dispersed, they fall as if floating in the air due to air resistance and stay in the air for some time. As a result, the seeds are scattered far away. Therefore, due to air resistance, the seeds of the plants such as simal, sal, etc. are dispersed far away. Activity . Observation of free fall ‘Take 'U’ shaped iron frame as shown in Figure .. Tie the open part of the frame with a thread so that itis slack as shown in the picture. Also, tie a stone between the threads. As shown in the picture, hang the hook of the spring balance on the place where the stone is tied and raise the whole frame. What is the weight shown by the spring balance? Then release the frame from the hand and observe the condition of the stone tied to the rope attached to the frame and the Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade reading of the spring balance. Lay a foam or cardboard on the floor to protect the spring balance during this activity. If possible, take a ‘video of the falling spring balance and pause i In this activity, when the frame is released from the hand, then the spring balance, the stone and the iron frame fall downwards with the same speed. Although the stone-bound thread is tied in such a way that itis slac T not stretch downwards. This aes makes it look like the stone is tron trame flying in the air. This is possible stone with free fall. Since both the spring balance and the frame are Fl90\"e . Observation of free fll in the state of froe fall. there is no downward force on the spring of the spring balance and it shows zero ‘wight. Thus. the weight of an object in free fall is zero, and hence, it is called weightlessness.Astronauts inside the artificial satellites orbiting the earth and space station are in a state of free fall. In such a situation, passengers inside the vehicle experience weightlessness. Equation of motion for free fall The equations of motion are used to calculate the final velocity and acceleration of a freely falling stone in activity .. In this way. the speed with which a freely falling body dropped from a height reaches the surface, the time taken to reach the surface, and the height can be calculated by using the equation of motion. For the objects in linear motion For the objects in free fall utgt vis ul+2gh zur In this way, in the case where the acceleration is generated due to the force of gravity, the value of the acceleration due to gravity is substituted in place of the acceleration in the equation of motion. If Science and Tochnology, Grade the object is thrown vertically upwards, the value of the acceleration due to gravity is negative because the acceleration generated in such a situation is in the opposite direction. Example . When a stone is dropped from a bridge over a river into the water. the sound of the stone hitting the surface of the water is heard after seconds. Calculate the height of the bridge above the surface of the water.(g = . m/s\") According to the information given in the question, The initial velocity of the stone (u) = m/s because the stone is dropped from the hand.

Orh= x98x2 Or h=.6m Therefore, the height of the bridge from the water level is .6m. Example . Accricket ball thrown vertically upwards into the sky reaches a height of 30m. Calculate the velocity with which it is thrown and the time taken to reach the maximum height. As given in the question, Maximum height of the ball (h) = m The final velocity of the ball (v) = m/s (since the final velocity at maximum height is zero. ome Sconce and Tachnalogs, Grade . m/s Acceleration of the ball g) Using the equations of motion for the initial velocity of the ball O=u? + 2gh or +2x- x or u=V588=. m/s For the time taken to reach the maximum height vsutat Or = .-. xt Or t= t= So, the initial velocity of the cricket ball is .25m/s and it takes . toreach the maximum height.

Place tin or some other sound-producing object on the surface of the ground to know when the stone hits the ground. After this, find the height and the time it takes to hit the ground. Find the height of a house, school building, etc. using the equation of motion. For this, take the average measurement to reduce the probable error.
